# House Price Prediction 

This project is a simple implementation of a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can estimate house prices based on various input features such as number of rooms, square footage, and location data. It involves data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation using regression techniques. The goal is to understand how different features impact house prices and to practice applying machine learning workflows.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization)

## Purpose

This project was created for learning purposes to explore:

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Building regression models
- Evaluating model performance

## Status

- Completed basic training and evaluation for prediction.
-  Still experimenting with improving accuracy.
